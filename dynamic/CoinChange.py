'''
Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents,
and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins,
how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions:
{1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4. 
For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions:
{2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.
This is same as finding partitions of a number, just now the arr would hold all the numbers upto that integer

#using pure DP, this is also knowns as bottom up since we are calculating starting for 0,1,2 and reaching higher values
# very effective also able to calculate partitions for 10000. 
# not possible with even with DP recursion
# After 5 year I have no idea why this code is doing, found the below video
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fgjrs570YE&list=PLrmLmBdmIlpsHaNTPP_jHHDx_os9ItYXr&index=16
# after thinking about it for a while got it, so always note down, it's no use if you forget
# Bottom up DP requires you to see how the recursion was precisely building the complete solution i.e. what kind of 
# subproblems were being created and how they filled the base case hence it's somewhat difficult to write bottom up DP. 
# In Top down (recursion with memoization) you have to write a backtrack solution (which is still hard) and see the state of backtrack solution. 
# Time complexities wise bottom up DP is better since in Top down it requires function calls and therefore implicit stack formation.
